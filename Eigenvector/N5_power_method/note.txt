1. I edit the 'CMakeLists.txt', because only two files ("L_power.cpp" and "L_power" respectively) are needed.
Original 'CMakeLists.txt' is in './old_codes/'

2. In our computer, we cannot make an output file whose name is "L_power", because the error below occurs :
" error: right operand of shift expression ‘(1 << 36)’ is >= than the precision of the left operand [-fpermissive]
  169 |   constexpr size_t num_matrix = 1 << (N * N); "
by 'g++ L_power.cpp -o L_power -Ofast'.

It seems to be due to the limit of memories of our computer, which may not be the problem in the Fugaku.

3. The command 'sbatch' in my whole.sh may be equivalent to the 'qsub' that is proper for other computers.
